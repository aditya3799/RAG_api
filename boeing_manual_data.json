    "Boeing 737 Operations Manual Supplementary Procedures Chapter SP Adverse Weather Section 16 SIPn.1t6r oSudpuplecmtieontnary Procedures-Adverse Weather Airplane operation in adverse weather conditions may require additional considerations due to the effects of extreme temperatures, precipitation, turbulence, and windshear. Procedures in this section supplement normal procedures and should be observed when applicable. The following recommendations apply to adverse weather operations in general: • Do not use assumed temperature reduced thrust for takeoff on a contaminated runway. • V1 may be reduced down to minimum V1 (assuming all weight limitations are considered) to provide increased stopping distance performance. • Takeoffs on slippery runways are not recommended if the crosswind exceeds 15 knots or when slush or wet snow is more than 1/2 inch (13mm) in depth. • Improved stall margins can be achieved by the following: • If excess runway is available, consider using improved climb procedures for flaps 5. • If runway is limited for the planned takeoff flap setting, consider using the next greater flap position with improved climb performance. This will provide additional stall margins with minimum performance penalties. Cold Weather Operation Considerations associated with cold weather operation are primarily concerned with low temperatures and with ice and snow on the airplane, ramps, taxiways and runways. Icing conditions exist when OAT (on the ground) or TAT (inflight) is 10°C (50°F) or below and: • visible moisture (clouds, fog with visibility less than one mile, rain, snow, sleet, ice crystals, and so on) is present, or • standing water, ice, or snow is present on the ramps, taxiways, or runways. CAUTION:Do not operate engine or wing anti–ice when inflight total air temperature (TAT) is above 10°C (50°F.) Copyright ©The Boeing Company. See title page for details.

    "Boeing 737 Operations Manual Normal Procedures Chapter NP Introduction Section 10 NP.10 Normal Procedures-Introduction General This chapter contains Normal Procedures. The first section incorporates routine normal procedures and associated flight patterns. The second section incorporates supplementary procedures that are accomplished as required rather than routinely performed. Controls and Indications – Nomenclature Controls and indications appear in all UPPERCASE type to correspond to the words on the control panel or display. For example, the following item has UPPERCASE words to match what is found on the panel: EQUIPMENT COOLING switches .......................................NORMAL The word EQUIPMENT is spelled out, even though it is abbreviated on the panel. The following appears in all lower case because there are no words identifying the panel name. Engine display control panel ..............................................................Set Normal Procedures Normal procedures are used by the trained flight crew to ensure airplane condition is acceptable and that the flight deck is correctly configured for each phase of flight. These procedures assume all systems are operating normally and automated features are fully utilized. Procedures are performed from recall and follow a panel flow. Checklists are used to verify that critical items affecting safety have been accomplished. These procedures are designed to minimize crew workload and are consistent with flight deck technology. During accomplishment of procedures, it is the crew member’s responsibility to ensure proper system response. If an improper indication is noted, first verify that the system controls are properly positioned. Then, if necessary, check the appropriate circuit breaker(s), and test related system light(s.) Before engine start, individual system lights are used to verify system status.

With Auto selected, the signs are controlled automatically by reference to landing gear and flap positions: FASTEN BELTS and RETURN TO SEAT signs: • illuminate when flaps or gear are extended • extinguish when flaps and gear are retracted. NO SMOKING signs: • illuminate when gear is extended • extinguish when gear is retracted. All passenger signs can be controlled manually by positioning the respective switch to ON or OFF. When the passenger cabin signs illuminate or extinguish, a low tone sounds over the PA system. Emergency Lighting Exit lights are located throughout the passenger cabin to indicate the approved emergency exit routes. The system is controlled by a switch on the overhead panel. The switch has three positions, OFF, ARMED and ON and is guarded to the ARMED position. With the switch in the ARMED position, the emergency exit lights are normally extinguished. If electrical power to DC bus No. 1 fails or if AC power has been turned off, the emergency exit lights illuminate automatically. The emergency exit lights may also be illuminated by a switch on the aft attendants panel. Lifting the guard and pushing the switch ON overrides the flight deck control and illuminates the emergency exit lights. Control from this panel is available in the event of failure of the automatic control. The flight deck aft DOME light contains a separate bulb that is powered by the emergency lighting system to provide for flight deck evacuation.

    "Normal Procedures - Introduction Boeing 737 Operations Manual Autopilot Flight Director System and Flight Management System Monitoring When the autopilot, flight director, or autothrottles are in use and a mode change is selected or is scheduled to occur, the annunciation must be verified on the flight mode annunciation display. Airplane course, vertical path, and speed must always be monitored. Similarly, when a thrust mode change is selected or is scheduled to occur, the annunciation must be verified on the thrust mode display. In LNAV and VNAV, all airplane course, vertical path, thrust and speed changes must be verified. CDU Operation On the ground, the control display unit (CDU) entries are normally performed by the first officer and verified by the captain. In flight, CDU entries are normally accomplished by the pilot not flying and verified by the pilot flying prior to execution. CDU entries should be accomplished prior to high workload periods such as departure, arrival, or holding. During high workload periods, using the autopilot modes such as heading select, level change, and the altitude and speed intervention features, if available, may be more efficient than entering complex route modifications into the CDU.

    "Supplementary Procedures - Adverse Weather Boeing 737 Operations Manual Windshear Windshear is a change of wind speed and/or direction over a short distance along the flight path. Severe windshear is that which produces airspeed changes greater than 15 knots or vertical speed changes greater than 500 feet per minute. Avoidance The flight crew should search for any clues to the presence of windshear along the intended flight path. Stay clear of thunderstorm cells and heavy precipitation and areas of known windshear. If severe windshear is indicated, delay takeoff or do not continue an approach. The presence of windshear may be indicated by: • Thunderstorm activity • Virga (rain that evaporates before reaching the ground) • PIREPS • Low level windshear alerting system (LLWAS) warnings Precaution If windshear is suspected, be especially alert to any of the danger signals and be prepared for the possibility of an inadvertent encounter. The following precautionary actions are recommended if windshear is suspected: Takeoff • Use maximum takeoff thrust instead of reduced thrust. • Use the longest suitable runway. • Be alert for any airspeed fluctuations during takeoff and initial climb. Such fluctuations may be the first indication of windshear. • Know the all–engine initial climb pitch attitude. Rotate at the normal rate to this attitude for all non–engine failure takeoffs. Minimize reductions from the initial climb pitch attitude until terrain and obstruction clearance is assured, unless stick shaker activates. • Crew coordination and awareness are very important. Develop an awareness of normal values of airspeed, attitude, vertical speed, and airspeed build–up. Closely monitor vertical flight path instruments such as vertical speed and altimeters. The pilot not flying should be especially aware of vertical flight path instruments and call out any deviations from normal. • Should airspeed fall below the trim airspeed, unusual control column",
    "Normal Procedures - Amplified Procedures Boeing 737 Operations Manual Approach Procedure Using flaps as speed brakes is not recommended. The following procedures are used for flap extension: • Select flaps 1 when decelerating through the flaps–up maneuvering speed, displayed on the airspeed display as a “UP”. • Set airspeed cursor to the flap maneuvering speed displayed as “1”. • When appropriate, select the next flap position and then set the airspeed cursor to that flap maneuver speed. Note: Flap maneuver speeds provide approximately 15 to 20 knots above the minimum maneuvering speed for each flap setting. Note: If performance requires the use of flaps 15 for landing, place the GROUND PROXIMITY flap inhibit switch to FLAP INHIBIT. If the flap maneuvering speeds cannot be displayed, reference the Performance In–flight section for speed schedules. When on final approach in landing configuration, it is not recommended to set the A/T command speed to allow for wind or gust corrections. Through airspeed and acceleration sensing, the A/T corrects for normal wind gusts. Higher command speed settings result in excessive approach speeds. The recommended A/T approach speed setting is VREF + 5. Copyright ©The Boeing Company. See title page for details. NP.20.36 D6-27370-TBC September 30, 2002",

    "Normal Procedures - Amplified Procedures Boeing 737 Operations Manual Approach Procedure Using flaps as speed brakes is not recommended. The following procedures are used for flap extension: • Select flaps 1 when decelerating through the flaps–up maneuvering speed, displayed on the airspeed display as a “UP”. • Set airspeed cursor to the flap maneuvering speed displayed as “1”. • When appropriate, select the next flap position and then set the airspeed cursor to that flap maneuver speed. Note: Flap maneuver speeds provide approximately 15 to 20 knots above the minimum maneuvering speed for each flap setting. Note: If performance requires the use of flaps 15 for landing, place the GROUND PROXIMITY flap inhibit switch to FLAP INHIBIT. If the flap maneuvering speeds cannot be displayed, reference the Performance In–flight section for speed schedules. When on final approach in landing configuration, it is not recommended to set the A/T command speed to allow for wind or gust corrections. Through airspeed and acceleration sensing, the A/T corrects for normal wind gusts. Higher command speed settings result in excessive approach speeds. The recommended A/T approach speed setting is VREF + 5. Copyright ©The Boeing Company. See title page for details. NP.20.36 D6-27370-TBC September 30, 2002",
    "Supplementary Procedures - Adverse Weather Boeing 737 Operations Manual • If windshear should be encountered near VR, and airspeed suddenly decreases, there may not be sufficient runway left to accelerate back to the normal VR. If there is insufficient runway left to stop, initiate a normal rotation at least 2000 feet before the end of the runway even if airspeed is low. Higher than normal attitudes may be required to lift–off in the remaining runway. Approach and Landing • Select the minimum landing flap position consistent with field length. • Add an appropriate airspeed correction (correction applied in the same manner as gust), the maximum command speed should not exceed the lower of Vref + 20 knots or landing flap placard speed minus 5 knots. • Avoid large thrust reductions or trim changes in response to sudden airspeed increases as these may be followed by airspeed decreases. • Crosscheck flight director commands using vertical flight path instruments. • Crew coordination and awareness are very important, particularly at night or in marginal weather conditions. Closely monitor the vertical flight path instruments such as vertical speed, altimeters, and glideslope displacement. The pilot not flying should call out any deviations from normal. Use of the autopilot and autothrottle for the approach may provide more monitoring and recognition time.

    "Boeing 737 Operations Manual Normal Procedures Chapter NP Introduction Section 10 NP.10 Normal Procedures-Introduction General This chapter contains Normal Procedures. The first section incorporates routine normal procedures and associated flight patterns. The second section incorporates supplementary procedures that are accomplished as required rather than routinely performed. Controls and Indications – Nomenclature Controls and indications appear in all UPPERCASE type to correspond to the words on the control panel or display. For example, the following item has UPPERCASE words to match what is found on the panel: EQUIPMENT COOLING switches .......................................NORMAL The word EQUIPMENT is spelled out, even though it is abbreviated on the panel. The following appears in all lower case because there are no words identifying the panel name. Engine display control panel ..............................................................Set Normal Procedures Normal procedures are used by the trained flight crew to ensure airplane condition is acceptable and that the flight deck is correctly configured for each phase of flight. These procedures assume all systems are operating normally and automated features are fully utilized. Procedures are performed from recall and follow a panel flow. Checklists are used to verify that critical items affecting safety have been accomplished. These procedures are designed to minimize crew workload and are consistent with flight deck technology. During accomplishment of procedures, it is the crew member’s responsibility to ensure proper system response. If an improper indication is noted, first verify that the system controls are properly positioned. Then, if necessary, check the appropriate circuit breaker(s), and test related system light(s.) Before engine start, individual system lights are used to verify system status.

    "Normal Procedures - Introduction Boeing 737 Operations Manual After engine start, the MASTER CAUTION system, annunciator lights, and alerts are used as the primary means to alert the crew to a non-normal system condition. Illumination of the MASTER CAUTION and system annunciator lights requires accomplishment of the appropriate non–normal procedure. Upon completion of the procedure and prior to takeoff, the Dispatch Deviations Guide (DDG) or airline equivalent should be consulted to determine if MEL relief is available. Flight crew duties are organized in accordance with an area of responsibility concept. Each crewmember is assigned a flight deck area where the crewmember initiates actions for required procedures.The panel illustrations in this section describe each crewmember’s area of responsibility for pre/post flight and phase of flight. Pre/post flight duties are apportioned between the captain and first officer, while phase of flight duties are apportioned between the Pilot Flying (PF) and Pilot Not Flying (PNF.) A normal scan flow is encouraged; however, certain items may be handled in the most logical sequence for existing conditions. Actions outside the crew member’s area of responsibility are initiated at the direction of the captain. General phase of flight responsibilities are as follows: Pilot flying (PF): • flight path and airspeed control • airplane configuration • navigation. Pilot not flying (PNF): • checklist reading • communications • tasks requested by PF • start levers and fire switches (with PF concurrence.) Phase of flight duties, beginning with the Takeoff Procedure and ending with completion of the Landing Roll Procedure, are presented in table form in the appropriate procedures section. The first officer, when flying the airplane, performs the duties listed under PF, and the captain performs those duties listed under PNF.

Regulations require a 5% allowance for performance deterioration unless a value has been established by the operator for inservice deterioration. As noted below each table, the fuel required is the greater of the two engine fuel and the single engine fuel. This fuel is compared to the amount of fuel normally onboard the airplane at that point in the route. If the fuel required by the critical fuel reserves exceeds the amount of fuel normally expected, the fuel load must be adjusted accordingly. Landing Tables are provided for determining the maximum landing weight as limited by field length or climb requirements for a single landing flap.

    "Normal Procedures - Introduction Boeing 737 Operations Manual After engine start, the MASTER CAUTION system, annunciator lights, and alerts are used as the primary means to alert the crew to a non-normal system condition. Illumination of the MASTER CAUTION and system annunciator lights requires accomplishment of the appropriate non–normal procedure. Upon completion of the procedure and prior to takeoff, the Dispatch Deviations Guide (DDG) or airline equivalent should be consulted to determine if MEL relief is available. Flight crew duties are organized in accordance with an area of responsibility concept. Each crewmember is assigned a flight deck area where the crewmember initiates actions for required procedures.The panel illustrations in this section describe each crewmember’s area of responsibility for pre/post flight and phase of flight. Pre/post flight duties are apportioned between the captain and first officer, while phase of flight duties are apportioned between the Pilot Flying (PF) and Pilot Not Flying (PNF.) A normal scan flow is encouraged; however, certain items may be handled in the most logical sequence for existing conditions. Actions outside the crew member’s area of responsibility are initiated at the direction of the captain. General phase of flight responsibilities are as follows: Pilot flying (PF): • flight path and airspeed control • airplane configuration • navigation. Pilot not flying (PNF): • checklist reading • communications • tasks requested by PF • start levers and fire switches (with PF concurrence.) Phase of flight duties, beginning with the Takeoff Procedure and ending with completion of the Landing Roll Procedure, are presented in table form in the appropriate procedures section. The first officer, when flying the airplane, performs the duties listed under PF, and the captain performs those duties listed under PNF. Note: Although the mode control panel is designated as the PF’s responsibility, the PNF should operate the",

If airplane deicing was accomplished: A visual inspection of the airplane wings should be made by the pilots just prior to takeoff. Engine run–up ....................................................Accomplish as required If moderate to severe icing conditions are present, takeoff roll must be preceded by a static run–up to 70% N1 and stable engine operation observed prior to brake release. If the airplane starts to slide on ice or snow during engine power check, release brakes and begin takeoff roll. Continue engine check during early part of takeoff roll. Climb and Cruise Note: After the flaps are up, wing anti–ice should be used to melt any accumulation of slush. Engine Anti–Ice Operation-Inflight Engine anti–ice must be ON during all flight operations when icing conditions exist or are anticipated, except during climb and cruise when the temperature is below –40°C SAT. Engine anti–ice must be ON prior to, and during, descent in all icing conditions, including temperatures below –40°C SAT. When operating in areas of possible icing, activate engine anti–ice prior to entering icing conditions. Late selection of engine anti–ice may allow inlet ice buildup and ice shedding into the engine.

    "Performance Dispatch 737-600/CFM56-7B22 Text FAA/JAROPS Boeing 737 Operations Manual Category D Brakes Field and Climb Limit Weight Tables are presented for selected airport pressure altitudes and runway conditions and show both Field and Climb Limit Weights. Enter the appropriate table for pressure altitude and runway condition with “Slope and Wind Corrected Field Length” determined above and airport OAT to obtain Field Limit Weight. Also read Climb Limit Weight for the same OAT. Intermediate altitudes may be interpolated or use next higher altitude. When finding a maximum weight for a wet runway, the dry runway limit weight must also be determined and the lower of the two weights used. Obstacle Limit Weight The Reference Obstacle Limit Weight table provides obstacle limit weights for reference airport conditions based on obstacle height above the runway surface and distance from brake release. Enter the adjustment tables to adjust the reference Obstacle Limit Weight for the effects of OAT, pressure altitude and wind as indicated. In the case of multiple obstacles, enter the tables successively with each obstacle and determine the most limiting weight. When using line-up allowances with the Obstacle Limit chart, the obstacle distance from brake release must be reduced by the ASDA adjustment. Enroute Long Range Cruise Maximum Operating Altitude These tables provide the maximum operating altitude in the same manner as the FMC. Maximum altitudes are shown for a given cruise weight and maneuver capability. Note that this table considers both thrust and buffet limits, providing the more limiting of the two. Any data that is thrust limited is denoted by an asterisk and represents only a thrust limited condition in level flight with 100 ft/min residual rate of climb. Flying above these altitudes with sustained banks in excess of approximately 15° may cause the airplane to lose speed and/or altitude.",

The takeoff data provided is for a single takeoff flap at max takeoff thrust. The range of conditions covered is limited to those normally encountered in airline operation. In the event of conflict between the data presented in this chapter and that contained in the approved Airplane Flight Manual, the Flight Manual shall always take precedence. Takeoff The maximum allowable takeoff weight will be the least of the Field, Climb and Obstacle Limit Weights as determined from the tables shown. Tire and Brake Energy Limits are not shown as they are not limiting for the range of conditions shown in this chapter. JAROPS-1 requires that the runway length be adjusted to account for alignment of the airplane prior to takeoff. The table below provides TORA, TODA and ASDA adjustments for both 90 degree taxiway entry and 180 degree turnaround. For the 180 degree turnaround case, adjustments are provided for both a nominal 60 m runway as well as the minimum required for the stated minimum pavement width. These values may be used when obtaining takeoff weights from the Airplane Flight Manual or a takeoff analysis program. When using line-up allowances with the Field Length Limit chart, the field length available must be reduced by the ASDA adjustment. 90 DEGREE 180 DEGREE TURNAROUND TAXIWAY ENTRY NOMINAL LINE-UP MINIMUM LINE-UP MINIMUM LINE-UP DISTANCE (M) DISTANCE (M) DISTANCE (M) (60.0 M RUNWAY) (24.4 M RUNWAY) TORA & TODA 9.6 15.0 15.0 ASDA 20.9 26.4 26.4 Field Limit Weight - Slope and",

    "Supplementary Procedures - Adverse Weather Boeing 737 Operations Manual • If cooling air is available from an outside source, the supply should be plugged in immediately after engine shutdown and should not be removed until just prior to engine start. • Keep all doors and windows, including cargo doors, closed as much as possible. • Electronic components which contribute to a high temperature level in the flight deck should be turned off while not needed. • Open all passenger cabin gasper outlets and close all window shades on the sun–exposed side of the passenger cabin. Brake temperature levels may be reached which can cause the wheel fuse plugs to melt and deflate the tires. Consider the following actions: • Be aware of brake temperature buildup when operating a series of short flight sectors. The energy absorbed by the brakes from each landing is accumulative. • Extending the landing gear early during the approach provides additional cooling for tires and brakes. • In–flight cooling time can be determined from the “Brake Cooling Schedule” in the Performance–Inflight section. During flight planning consider the following: • High temperatures inflict performance penalties which must be taken into account on the ground before takeoff. • Alternate takeoff procedures (No Engine Bleed Takeoff, Improved Climb Performance, etc.) Moderate to Heavy Rain Flights should be conducted to avoid thunderstorm or hail activity by overflight or circumnavigation. To the maximum extent possible, moderate to heavy rain should also be avoided. If heavy rain is encountered: ENGINE START switches.......................................................CONT Thrust Levers...............................................................Adjust Slowly If thrust changes are necessary, move the thrust levers slowly. Avoid changing thrust lever direction until engines have stabilized at a selected setting. Copyright ©The Boeing Company. See title page for details. SP.16.12 D6-27370-TBC September 30, 2002",

    "Supplementary Procedures - Adverse Weather Boeing 737 Operations Manual Windshear Windshear is a change of wind speed and/or direction over a short distance along the flight path. Severe windshear is that which produces airspeed changes greater than 15 knots or vertical speed changes greater than 500 feet per minute. Avoidance The flight crew should search for any clues to the presence of windshear along the intended flight path. Stay clear of thunderstorm cells and heavy precipitation and areas of known windshear. If severe windshear is indicated, delay takeoff or do not continue an approach. The presence of windshear may be indicated by: • Thunderstorm activity • Virga (rain that evaporates before reaching the ground) • PIREPS • Low level windshear alerting system (LLWAS) warnings Precaution If windshear is suspected, be especially alert to any of the danger signals and be prepared for the possibility of an inadvertent encounter. The following precautionary actions are recommended if windshear is suspected: Takeoff • Use maximum takeoff thrust instead of reduced thrust. • Use the longest suitable runway. • Be alert for any airspeed fluctuations during takeoff and initial climb. Such fluctuations may be the first indication of windshear. • Know the all–engine initial climb pitch attitude. Rotate at the normal rate to this attitude for all non–engine failure takeoffs. Minimize reductions from the initial climb pitch attitude until terrain and obstruction clearance is assured, unless stick shaker activates. • Crew coordination and awareness are very important. Develop an awareness of normal values of airspeed, attitude, vertical speed, and airspeed build–up. Closely monitor vertical flight path instruments such as vertical speed and altimeters. The pilot not flying should be especially aware of vertical flight path instruments and call out any deviations from normal. • Should airspeed fall below the trim airspeed, unusual control column",

Also read Climb Limit Weight for the same OAT. Intermediate altitudes may be interpolated or use next higher altitude. When finding a maximum weight for a wet runway, the dry runway limit weight must also be determined and the lower of the two weights used. Obstacle Limit Weight The Reference Obstacle Limit Weight table provides obstacle limit weights for reference airport conditions based on obstacle height above the runway surface and distance from brake release. Enter the adjustment tables to adjust the reference Obstacle Limit Weight for the effects of OAT, pressure altitude and wind as indicated. In the case of multiple obstacles, enter the tables successively with each obstacle and determine the most limiting weight.

    "Boeing 737 Operations Manual Supplementary Procedures Chapter SP Adverse Weather Section 16 SIPn.1t6r oSudpuplecmtieontnary Procedures-Adverse Weather Airplane operation in adverse weather conditions may require additional considerations due to the effects of extreme temperatures, precipitation, turbulence, and windshear. Procedures in this section supplement normal procedures and should be observed when applicable. The following recommendations apply to adverse weather operations in general: • Do not use assumed temperature reduced thrust for takeoff on a contaminated runway. • V1 may be reduced down to minimum V1 (assuming all weight limitations are considered) to provide increased stopping distance performance. • Takeoffs on slippery runways are not recommended if the crosswind exceeds 15 knots or when slush or wet snow is more than 1/2 inch (13mm) in depth. • Improved stall margins can be achieved by the following: • If excess runway is available, consider using improved climb procedures for flaps 5. • If runway is limited for the planned takeoff flap setting, consider using the next greater flap position with improved climb performance. This will provide additional stall margins with minimum performance penalties. Cold Weather Operation Considerations associated with cold weather operation are primarily concerned with low temperatures and with ice and snow on the airplane, ramps, taxiways and runways. Icing conditions exist when OAT (on the ground) or TAT (inflight) is 10°C (50°F) or below and: • visible moisture (clouds, fog with visibility less than one mile, rain, snow, sleet, ice crystals, and so on) is present, or • standing water, ice, or snow is present on the ramps, taxiways, or runways. CAUTION:Do not operate engine or wing anti–ice when inflight total air temperature (TAT) is above 10°C (50°F.) Copyright ©The Boeing Company. See title page for details.

    "Supplementary Procedures - Fuel Boeing 737 Operations Manual Refueling Fuel Load Distribution Main tanks No. 1 and No. 2 should normally be serviced equally until full. Additional fuel is loaded into the center tank until the desired fuel load is reached. Note: Main tanks No. 1 and No. 2 must be scheduled to be full if the center tank contains more than 453 kgs / 1,000 lbs of fuel. With less than 453 kgs / 1,000 lbs of center tank fuel, partial main tank fuel may be loaded provided the effects of balance have been considered. Fuel Pressure Apply from a truck or fuel pit. A nozzle pressure of 50 psi provides approximately 1136 liters / 300 U.S. gallons per minute. Normal Refueling [Option - Fuel Quantity selector] When a full fuel load is required, the fuel shutoff system closes the fueling valves automatically when the tanks are full. When a partial fuel load is required, the fuel shutoff system closes the fueling valves automatically when the quantity preselected on the fuel quantity selector (located on the test gauges and fueling panel) is reached. [Option - Without Fuel Quantity selector] When a full fuel load is required, the fuel shutoff system closes the fueling valves automatically when the tanks are full. When a partial fuel load is required, the fuel quantity indicators are monitored and the fueling valves are closed by manually positioning the fueling valve switches to CLOSED when the desired fuel quantity is aboard the airplane. Refueling with Battery Only When the APU is inoperative and external power is not available, refueling can be accomplished as follows: Battery switch ....................................................................................ON Note: The refueling system will operate normally.

    "distance and read trip fuel required for the expected landing weight, together with time to alternate at right. For distances greater than shown or other altitudes, use the Long Range Cruise Trip Fuel and Time tables. Holding Planning This table provides total fuel flow information necessary for planning flaps up holding and reserve fuel requirements. Data is based on the FMC holding speed schedule which is the higher of the maximum endurance and flaps up maneuver speeds. As noted, the fuel flow is based on flight in a racetrack holding pattern. For holding in straight and level flight, reduce table values by 5%. Crew Oxygen Requirements Tables are provided to determine the minimum dispatch oxygen pressure for protective breathing equipment used by the flight crew. Enter the number of crew plus observers using oxygen and read the minimum cylinder pressure required for the appropriate bottle temperature and size. These pressures provide sufficient oxygen for 15 minutes of protective breathing for each flight crew member plus 10% contingency at 8000 ft cabin pressure altitude. Route specific analysis is necessary to determine if additional oxygen pressure is needed to meet supplemental oxygen requirements. Copyright ©The Boeing Company. See title page for details.

    "Normal Procedures - Introduction Boeing 737 Operations Manual Autopilot Flight Director System and Flight Management System Monitoring When the autopilot, flight director, or autothrottles are in use and a mode change is selected or is scheduled to occur, the annunciation must be verified on the flight mode annunciation display. Airplane course, vertical path, and speed must always be monitored. Similarly, when a thrust mode change is selected or is scheduled to occur, the annunciation must be verified on the thrust mode display. In LNAV and VNAV, all airplane course, vertical path, thrust and speed changes must be verified. CDU Operation On the ground, the control display unit (CDU) entries are normally performed by the first officer and verified by the captain. In flight, CDU entries are normally accomplished by the pilot not flying and verified by the pilot flying prior to execution. CDU entries should be accomplished prior to high workload periods such as departure, arrival, or holding. During high workload periods, using the autopilot modes such as heading select, level change, and the altitude and speed intervention features, if available, may be more efficient than entering complex route modifications into the CDU.

    "Supplementary Procedures - Adverse Weather Boeing 737 Operations Manual • If cooling air is available from an outside source, the supply should be plugged in immediately after engine shutdown and should not be removed until just prior to engine start. • Keep all doors and windows, including cargo doors, closed as much as possible. • Electronic components which contribute to a high temperature level in the flight deck should be turned off while not needed. • Open all passenger cabin gasper outlets and close all window shades on the sun–exposed side of the passenger cabin. Brake temperature levels may be reached which can cause the wheel fuse plugs to melt and deflate the tires. Consider the following actions: • Be aware of brake temperature buildup when operating a series of short flight sectors. The energy absorbed by the brakes from each landing is accumulative. • Extending the landing gear early during the approach provides additional cooling for tires and brakes. • In–flight cooling time can be determined from the “Brake Cooling Schedule” in the Performance–Inflight section. During flight planning consider the following: • High temperatures inflict performance penalties which must be taken into account on the ground before takeoff. • Alternate takeoff procedures (No Engine Bleed Takeoff, Improved Climb Performance, etc.) Moderate to Heavy Rain Flights should be conducted to avoid thunderstorm or hail activity by overflight or circumnavigation. To the maximum extent possible, moderate to heavy rain should also be avoided.

    "Airplane General, Emergency Equipment, Doors, Windows - Systems Description Boeing 737 Operations Manual Flight Crew Oxygen System The flight crew oxygen system uses quick-donning, diluter-demand masks/ regulators located at each crew station. Oxygen is supplied by a single cylinder. Oxygen pressure is displayed on the Oxygen Pressure indicator located on the aft overhead panel when the battery switch is ON. Oxygen flow is controlled through an in-line, pressure-reducing regulator to supply low-pressure oxygen to the regulator on the mask. System pressure may be as high as 1850 psi. Oxygen flow is controlled by a regulator mounted on the oxygen mask. By pushing the NORMAL/100% control lever, the regulator is adjusted from the air/oxygen mixture to 100% oxygen. By rotating the EMERGENCY/PUSH TO TEST selector, the regulator is adjusted to supply oxygen under pressure. Flight Crew Oxygen Mask Usage Donning Instructions To don the mask, grasp the regulator with the thumb and forefinger and remove from stowage. Squeezing the inflation levers and removing from the box: • inflates the mask harness • momentarily displays a colored oxygen flow indicator. • Place the mask over the head and release the levers. The harness contracts to fit the mask to head and face. The observer’s oxygen mask, regulator, and harness unit is the same as the pilots’. Copyright ©The Boeing Company.

The takeoff data provided is for a single takeoff flap at max takeoff thrust. The range of conditions covered is limited to those normally encountered in airline operation. In the event of conflict between the data presented in this chapter and that contained in the approved Airplane Flight Manual, the Flight Manual shall always take precedence. Takeoff The maximum allowable takeoff weight will be the least of the Field, Climb and Obstacle Limit Weights as determined from the tables shown. Tire and Brake Energy Limits are not shown as they are not limiting for the range of conditions shown in this chapter. JAROPS-1 requires that the runway length be adjusted to account for alignment of the airplane prior to takeoff. The table below provides TORA, TODA and ASDA adjustments for both 90 degree taxiway entry and 180 degree turnaround. For the 180 degree turnaround case, adjustments are provided for both a nominal 60 m runway as well as the minimum required for the stated minimum pavement width. These values may be used when obtaining takeoff weights from the Airplane Flight Manual or a takeoff analysis program. When using line-up allowances with the Field Length Limit chart, the field length available must be reduced by the ASDA adjustment. 90 DEGREE 180 DEGREE TURNAROUND TAXIWAY ENTRY NOMINAL LINE-UP MINIMUM LINE-UP MINIMUM LINE-UP DISTANCE (M) DISTANCE (M) DISTANCE (M) (60.0 M RUNWAY) (24.4 M RUNWAY) TORA & TODA 9.6 15.0 15.0 ASDA 20.9 26.4 26.4 Field Limit Weight - Slope and",

    "Supplementary Procedures - Adverse Weather Boeing 737 Operations Manual Wing Anti–Ice Operation–On the Ground Wing anti–ice must be ON during all ground operations between engine start and takeoff, when icing conditions exist or are anticipated, unless the airplane is protected by the application of Type II or Type IV fluid in compliance with an approved ground de–icing program. WARNING:Ground use of the wing anti–ice system is intended to complement, and not replace, ground de–icing/anti–icing and inspection procedures. Close inspection is still required to ensure that no frost, snow or ice is adhering to the wing, leading edge devices, stabilizer, control surfaces, or other critical airplane components at takeoff. WING ANTI–ICE switch......................................................As required If wing anti–ice switch is ON: VALVE OPEN lights – illuminated dim Note:The wing anti–ice VALVE OPEN lights may cycle bright/dim due to control valves cycling closed/open in response to thrust setting and duct temperature logic. Taxi–Out Nose wheel steering.......................................................................Check Nose wheel steering should be exercised in both directions during taxi to circulate warm hydraulic fluid through steering cylinders and minimize steering lag caused by low temperatures. Flaps ......................................................................................As required If taxi route is through slush or standing water in low temperatures or if precipitation is falling with temperatures below freezing, taxi with flaps up. Taxiing with flaps extended subjects the flaps and flap drives to snow and slush accumulations from the main gear wheels. Leading edge devices are also susceptible to slush accumulations. If exterior deicing is required: Flaps ..............................................................................................UP Prevents ice and slush from accumulating in flap cavities.

    "Airplane General, Emergency Equipment, Doors, Windows - Boeing 737 Operations Manual Systems Description Passenger Portable Oxygen First aid and supplemental portable oxygen cylinders are installed at suitable locations in the passenger cabin. The cylinders are fitted with a pressure gage, pressure regulator and on–off valve. The cylinders are pressurized to 1800 psi. At this pressure and a temperature of 70 degrees Fahrenheit, (21 degrees Celsius) the cylinders have a capacity of 4.25 cubic feet (120 liters) of free oxygen. Two continuous flow outlets are provided on each cylinder, one regulates flow at two liters per minute for walk–around; the second outlet provides flow at four liters per minute. The four–liter flow is used for first aid. Duration can be determined by dividing capacity by outflow (120 liters divided by 4 liters/minute = 30 minutes).

    "Normal Procedures - Amplified Procedures Boeing 737 Operations Manual Note: Standard day, sea level, approximate stabilized idle indications for the CFM56–7 engine. • N1 RPM – 20% • EGT – 410°C** • N2 RPM – 59% • Fuel Flow – 272 KGPH/600 PPH ** Idle EGT may vary from 320°C – 520°C depending on OAT, bleed configuration, and engine conditions. Starter Duty Cycle • Limit each start attempt to a maximum of 2 minutes • A minimum of 10 seconds is required between start attempts CAUTION: Normal engine start considerations: • Advancing engine start lever to idle prematurely can cause a “HOT” start. • Keep hand on engine start lever while observing RPM, EGT and fuel flow until stabilized. • If fuel is shutoff inadvertently (by closing engine start lever) do not reopen engine start lever in an attempt to restart engine. • Failure of ENGINE START switch to hold in GRD until starter cutout RPM is reached can result in a “HOT” start. Do not re–engage ENGINE START switch until engine RPM is below 20% N2. Note: Accomplish the ABORTED ENGINE START checklist for one or more of the following conditions: • No N1 rotation before the engine start lever is raised to IDLE. • No oil pressure indication by the time the engine is stabilized at idle. • No increase in EGT within 10 seconds of raising the engine start lever to IDLE. • No increase in, or a very slow increase in N1 or N2 after EGT indication. • EGT rapidly approaching or exceeding the start limit.

The primary method is to use it as a de–icer by allowing ice to accumulate before turning wing anti–ice on. This procedure provides the cleanest airfoil surface, the least possible runback ice formation, and the least thrust and fuel penalty. The secondary method is to use wing anti––ice prior to ice accumulation. Operate the wing anti–ice system as an anti–icer only during extended operations in moderate or severe icing conditions, such as holding. Ice accumulation on the flight deck window frames, windshield center post or on the windshield wiper arm may be used as an indication of structural icing conditions and the need to turn on wing anti–ice. Normally it is not necessary to shed ice periodically unless extended flight through icing conditions is necessary (holding).

    "Supplementary Procedures - Fuel Boeing 737 Operations Manual Refueling Fuel Load Distribution Main tanks No. 1 and No. 2 should normally be serviced equally until full. Additional fuel is loaded into the center tank until the desired fuel load is reached. Note: Main tanks No. 1 and No. 2 must be scheduled to be full if the center tank contains more than 453 kgs / 1,000 lbs of fuel. With less than 453 kgs / 1,000 lbs of center tank fuel, partial main tank fuel may be loaded provided the effects of balance have been considered. Fuel Pressure Apply from a truck or fuel pit. A nozzle pressure of 50 psi provides approximately 1136 liters / 300 U.S. gallons per minute. Normal Refueling [Option - Fuel Quantity selector] When a full fuel load is required, the fuel shutoff system closes the fueling valves automatically when the tanks are full. When a partial fuel load is required, the fuel shutoff system closes the fueling valves automatically when the quantity preselected on the fuel quantity selector (located on the test gauges and fueling panel) is reached. [Option - Without Fuel Quantity selector] When a full fuel load is required, the fuel shutoff system closes the fueling valves automatically when the tanks are full. When a partial fuel load is required, the fuel quantity indicators are monitored and the fueling valves are closed by manually positioning the fueling valve switches to CLOSED when the desired fuel quantity is aboard the airplane. Refueling with Battery Only When the APU is inoperative and external power is not available, refueling can be accomplished as follows: Battery switch ....................................................................................ON Note: The refueling system will operate normally. Operation is limited only by battery life. Copyright ©The Boeing Company. See title page for details. SP.12.2 D6-27370-TBC August 30, 2000",

    "Airplane General, Emergency Equipment, Doors, Windows - Systems Description Boeing 737 Operations Manual Floor proximity emergency escape path lighting consists of locator lights spaced at regular intervals down one side of the aisle. Lighted arrows point to overwing exits and a lighted EXIT indicator is near the floor by each door and overwing exit. Escape path markings are provided for visual guidance for emergency cabin evacuation when other sources of cabin lighting are obscured. Interior Emergency Lighting [Option: Photoluminescent Lighting System] Interior emergency exit lights are located: • in the lower inboard corner of stowage bins to illuminate the aisle • over the entry/service and overwing emergency hatches to indicate the door and hatch exits • in the ceiling to locate the exits and provide general illumination in the area of the exits. Self–illuminating exit locator signs are installed at the forward, middle, and aft end of the passenger cabin. A photoluminescent floor path marking system is installed along the cabin aisle. The photoluminescent material, when excited by light, will glow and provide exit path guidance. At the exit, electrically operated lights and markers provide exit identification. The photoluminescent strips need to be properly charged. The table below contains charging information and can be used to determine how long the strips remain illuminated. For charging, the cabin ceiling, and sidewall lights need to be on at full intensity, and the strips should not be covered or blocked. Copyright ©The Boeing Company.

    "Performance Dispatch 737-600/CFM56-7B22 Text FAA/JAROPS Boeing 737 Operations Manual Category D Brakes Net Level Off Weight The Net Level Off Weight table is provided to determine terrain clearance capability in straight and level flight following an engine failure. Regulations require terrain clearance planning based on net performance which is the gross (or actual) gradient performance degraded by 1.1%. In addition, the net level off pressure altitude must clear the terrain by 1000 ft. To determine the maximum weight for terrain clearance, enter the table with required net level off pressure altitude and expected ISA deviation to obtain weight. Adjust weight for anti-ice operation as noted below the table. Extended Range Operations Regulations require that flights conducted over a route that contains a point further than one hour’s time at “normal one engine inoperative speed” from an adequate diversion airport comply with rules set up specifically for “Extended Range Operation with Two Engine airplanes.” This section provides reserve fuel planning information for the \"Critical Fuel Scenario\" based on two engine operation at Long Range Cruise as well as single engine operation at Long Range Cruise. Long Range Cruise Critical Fuel Reserves Enter the Ground to Air Miles Conversion table with forecast wind and ground distance to diversion airport from critical point to obtain air distance. Now enter the Critical Fuel table with air distance and expected weight at the critical point and read required fuel. Apply the noted fuel adjustments as necessary. Regulations require a 5% allowance for performance deterioration unless a value has been established by the operator for inservice deterioration. As noted below each table, the fuel required is the greater of the two engine fuel and the single engine fuel. This fuel is compared to the amount of fuel normally onboard the airplane at that point in the",
    "Supplementary Procedures - Adverse Weather Boeing 737 Operations Manual [Without automatic ignition] ENGINE START switches..........................................................OFF [Automatic ignition] ENGINE START switches.......................................................AUTO Wing Anti–Ice Operation – Inflight The wing anti–ice system may be used as a de–icer or anti–icer in flight only. The primary method is to use it as a de–icer by allowing ice to accumulate before turning wing anti–ice on. This procedure provides the cleanest airfoil surface, the least possible runback ice formation, and the least thrust and fuel penalty. The secondary method is to use wing anti––ice prior to ice accumulation. Operate the wing anti–ice system as an anti–icer only during extended operations in moderate or severe icing conditions, such as holding. Ice accumulation on the flight deck window frames, windshield center post or on the windshield wiper arm may be used as an indication of structural icing conditions and the need to turn on wing anti–ice. Normally it is not necessary to shed ice periodically unless extended flight through icing conditions is necessary (holding). CAUTION:Use of wing anti-ice above approximately FL350 may cause bleed trip off and possible loss of cabin pressure. When wing anti–ice is required: WING ANTI–ICE switch..............................................................ON R and L VALVE OPEN lights – illuminated dim When wing anti–ice is no longer required: WING ANTI–ICE switch............................................................OFF Note: Prolonged operation in icing conditions with the leading edge and trailing edge flaps extended is not recommended.

For distances greater than shown or other altitudes, use the Long Range Cruise Trip Fuel and Time tables. Holding Planning This table provides total fuel flow information necessary for planning flaps up holding and reserve fuel requirements. Data is based on the FMC holding speed schedule which is the higher of the maximum endurance and flaps up maneuver speeds. As noted, the fuel flow is based on flight in a racetrack holding pattern. For holding in straight and level flight, reduce table values by 5%. Crew Oxygen Requirements Tables are provided to determine the minimum dispatch oxygen pressure for protective breathing equipment used by the flight crew. Enter the number of crew plus observers using oxygen and read the minimum cylinder pressure required for the appropriate bottle temperature and size. These pressures provide sufficient oxygen for 15 minutes of protective breathing for each flight crew member plus 10% contingency at 8000 ft cabin pressure altitude. Route specific analysis is necessary to determine if additional oxygen pressure is needed to meet supplemental oxygen requirements. Copyright ©The Boeing Company. See title page for details.

    "Supplementary Procedures - Adverse Weather Boeing 737 Operations Manual • If windshear should be encountered near VR, and airspeed suddenly decreases, there may not be sufficient runway left to accelerate back to the normal VR. If there is insufficient runway left to stop, initiate a normal rotation at least 2000 feet before the end of the runway even if airspeed is low. Higher than normal attitudes may be required to lift–off in the remaining runway. Approach and Landing • Select the minimum landing flap position consistent with field length. • Add an appropriate airspeed correction (correction applied in the same manner as gust), the maximum command speed should not exceed the lower of Vref + 20 knots or landing flap placard speed minus 5 knots. • Avoid large thrust reductions or trim changes in response to sudden airspeed increases as these may be followed by airspeed decreases. • Crosscheck flight director commands using vertical flight path instruments. • Crew coordination and awareness are very important, particularly at night or in marginal weather conditions. Closely monitor the vertical flight path instruments such as vertical speed, altimeters, and glideslope displacement. The pilot not flying should call out any deviations from normal. Use of the autopilot and autothrottle for the approach may provide more monitoring and recognition time.

Any data that is thrust limited is denoted by an asterisk and represents only a thrust limited condition in level flight with 100 ft/min residual rate of climb. Flying above these altitudes with sustained banks in excess of approximately 15° may cause the airplane to lose speed and/or altitude. The altitudes shown in the table are limited to the maximum certified altitude of 41000 ft.
